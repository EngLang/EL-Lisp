LexicalChain
- version 2.0 -


CHANGES TO VERSION 1.0

1.0 is the version written by Mario Jarmasz. 2.0 contains changes implemented by Olena Medelyan:

1. Verbose output: The user has the option of seeing all the information 
about generating the lexical chains or only the final output.

2. Utility scripts from WEKA (Option.java, OptionHandler.java and Utils.java) 
are included into the package.

3. Included the scoring function HIndex proposed by Barzilay & Elhadad (1997):
   score(chain) = length*homogeneity
   length - number of all members in the chain
   homogeneity = 1 - distinct members/length

4. Included detection of top scored chains as proposed by Barzilay & Elhadad (1997):
   score(chain) > average(scores) + 2*StandardDeviation(scores).


5. Final output is converted into a more convenient form. When HIndex is used, only top scored chains are presented, leading by their most representative member, the ones with the highest frequency, which can be seen as a keyword.


TODO

- Check the morphological processing
- Check if not only words, but also phrases can be detected in the document
